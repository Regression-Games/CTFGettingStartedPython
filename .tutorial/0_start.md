# Regression Games Capture the Flag - Getting Started <a href="https://play.regression.gg"><img src="images/rg_long.png" height="50px"/></a>

Regression Games is an AI + gaming bot platform, and we are pleased to announce our newest game mode and tournament, the Alpha Cup, which features a Capture the Flag game in Minecraft. In this tutorial, we will write a simple bot that reacts to events within the game to capture the flag and score it within your teamâ€™s base! Read the section below to learn more about our game mode!

**This is our Python guide. Also see our TypeScript and JavaScript guides! PLEASE NOTE: Our Python support is experimental, and we recommend using
the other languages.**

**Want to skip the guide and just use the templates? Find those here: Typescript | JavaScript | Python**

The Alpha Cup, sponsored by Steamship, is a 3v3 Capture the Flag tournament in Minecraft.
Players program bots in TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python to score points by capturing
flags and killing the opposing team. The first team to 10 flag captures wins! Learn more
